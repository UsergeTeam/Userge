        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages)
                you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book
                you can use his phone number (str).

            message (``list`` | :obj: `Message`, *optional*):
                Either a list of messages or a single message.

            max_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Until which message should the read acknowledge be sent for.
                This has priority over the ``message`` parameter.

            clear_mentions (``bool``, *optional*):
                Whether the mention badge should be cleared (so that
                there are no more mentions) or not for the given entity.
                If no message is provided, this will be the only action
                taken.
                defaults to False.

        Returns:
            On success, True is returned.
